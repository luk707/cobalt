### glb-info

glb-info is a tiny utility for extracting and printing GLB file contents

####Â Usage

```
./glb-info [OPTIONS] file


POSITIONALS:
  file TEXT REQUIRED          Path to the GLB file

OPTIONS:
  -h,     --help              Print this help message and exit
  -o,     --output TEXT [default]
                              Output format (json or bin)
```

#### Common usage

1. Get an overview of GLB metadata

   ```sh
   ./glb-info path/to/file.glb
   ```

2. Output and pretty print the JSON chunk data (requires `jq`)

   ```sh
   ./glb-info path/to/file.glb -o json | jq
   ```

3. View the binary contents using `xxd`

   ```sh
   ./glb-info path/to/file.glb -o bin | xxd
   ```
