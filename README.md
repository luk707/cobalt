# Cobalt

This is a repository for some 3D experiments I'm working on.

## Building locally

This project is built using cmake. You can build the targets with the following commands:

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

You can now execute the targets.

## Targets

### cobalt-demo

You may need to export this on macos:

```sh
export VK_ICD_FILENAMES=/opt/homebrew/etc/vulkan/icd.d/MoltenVK_icd.json
```

also ensure that you have sdl2 and vulkan-tools, you can install with brew.

the provided shaders are in the demo directory, and can be compiled as follows:

```sh
glslangValidator -V shader.vert -o vert.spv
glslangValidator -V shader.frag -o frag.spv
```

the shaders must be available in the present working directory you run the binary from

I recommend adding the build/bin directory to your path (at least during development)

### glb-info

glb-info is a tiny utility for extracting and printing GLB file contents

for more information on the glTF specification see the following references:

[glTF 2.0.0 Specification](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.pdf)

[glTF 2.0.0 Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/refs/heads/main/specification/2.0/figures/gltfOverview-2.0.0d.png)

####Â Usage

```
./glb-info [OPTIONS] file


POSITIONALS:
  file TEXT REQUIRED          Path to the GLB file

OPTIONS:
  -h,     --help              Print this help message and exit
  -o,     --output TEXT [default]
                              Output format (json or bin)
```

#### Common usage

1. Get an overview of GLB metadata

   ```sh
   ./glb-info path/to/file.glb
   ```

2. Output and pretty print the JSON chunk data (requires `jq`)

   ```sh
   ./glb-info path/to/file.glb -o json | jq
   ```

3. View the binary contents using `xxd`

   ```sh
   ./glb-info path/to/file.glb -o bin | xxd
   ```
